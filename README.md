# Boombayah

Back-end service for the slack-plugin. Runs on node, to be built with purescript, deployed to either lambda or heroku

# Getting started

- install purescript

```zsh
npm install -g purescript bower pulp
```

# TODOs

Obviously, this is an early work-in-progress, so there will be plenty to do

- [ ] Figure out how to load node-dependencies
- [ ] Figure out how to build this with pulp
- [ ] Figure out how to mock and test
- [ ] Figure out how deploy this to lambda
